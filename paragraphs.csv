2,"This article contains the monthly cumulative number of deaths from the pandemic of COVID-19 reported by each country, territory, andsubnational areato theWorld Health Organization(WHO) and published in WHO reports, tables, and spreadsheets.[1][2][3]There are also maps and timeline graphs of daily and weekly deaths worldwide.[note 1][note 2]"
3,"There have been reported 7,084,010[4](updated 3 February 2025) confirmed COVID-induced deaths worldwide. As of January 2023, taking into account likely COVID induced deaths viaexcess deaths, the 95%confidence intervalsuggests the pandemic to have caused between 19.1 and 36 million deaths.[5][6]"

5,COVID-19 pandemicis the worst-ever worldwide calamity experienced on a large scale (with an estimated 7 million deaths) in the 21st century. The COVID-19 death toll is the highest seen on a global scale since theSpanish fluandWorld War II.

9,"A December 2022WHOstudy comprehensively estimatedexcess deathsfrom the pandemic during 2020 and 2021, concluding ~14.8 million excess early deaths occurred, reaffirming their prior calculations from May as well as updating them, addressing criticisms. These numbers do not include measures likeyears of potential life lost, far exceeding the 5.42 million officially reported deaths for that timeframe, may make the pandemic 2021'sleading cause of death, and are similar to the ~18 million estimated by another study (see below).[13][14][12]"
10,"In October 2020, a group of scientists, including those from theImperial College COVID-19 Response Team, published an analysis of the all-cause mortality effect of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic for 21 industrialised countries – including its timing, demographics andexcess deaths per capita– and assessed determinants for substantial variations in death rates such as the countries'pandemic preparedness and management.[15][16]"
11,"An analysis published inThe Lancetin March 2022 by Wang et al. suggests up to 18 million lives may have been lost to the pandemic.[17][18]Such deaths also include, for example, deaths due to healthcare capacity constraints and priorities, as well as reluctance to seek care (to avoid possible infection).[19]Further research may help distinguish the proportions directly caused by COVID-19 from those caused by indirect consequences of the pandemic.[18]"
